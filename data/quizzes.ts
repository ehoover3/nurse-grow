        answer: "Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid",
        answerExplanation:
          "A fatty acid is a long chain of carbon (C) atoms with hydrogen (H) atoms attached and a carboxyl group (-COOH) at one end. Saturated fatty acids: All carbon-carbon bonds are single bonds (C–C). No double bonds. Example: stearic acid. Monounsaturated fatty acids: One double bond (C=C) exists in the chain. Example: oleic acid. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs): Two or more double bonds (C=C) are present. Example: linoleic acid has 2 double bonds. So, if a fatty acid has exactly 2 double bonds, it cannot be saturated or monounsaturated—it must be polyunsaturated. That’s why “Polyunsaturated fatty acid” is the correct answer",
